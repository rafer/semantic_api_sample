I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we 
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of 
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me my 
current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the COO 
position.

   >Greg, how big was that last check you told me to watch for. I will 
transfer the remaining to the LIR. QQQ improved for your short today to close 
at 68 47/64. Nothing good out of CA utilities and power. Nat Gas lower today. 
I will watch tonight the new President and the vanquished. Also, will today's 
announcement about ENE effect you? Ben
