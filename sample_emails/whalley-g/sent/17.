Joe,

I have slotted you 90 minutes w/Greg on Wednesday @ 4:00 p.m.  Greg is 
scheduled to participate in a Houston conference call @ 5:30 p.m.  You guys 
are connecting again for dinner.  Please let me know the time and location 
for dinner on Wednesday night.  Also, Greg says his schedule is open enough 
that he would like to hang out on the floor w/you and your guys.  He will be 
officing over by John Sherriff and the mobile number he's carrying is +44  
7901516638.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
