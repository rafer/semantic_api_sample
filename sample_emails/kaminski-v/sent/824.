Q.  What is the Automated Tax Return (ATR) service?
A. Intuit Inc., makers of the popular Quicken TurboTax tax preparation and 
filing software, have launched a new Automated Tax Return (ATR) service to 
simplify tax preparation for TurboTax users. ATR allows users of TurboTax tax 
preparation and filing software to import tax information from multiple 
sources such as employers, brokerage houses, and mutual fund companies 
directly into the correct TurboTax forms over the Internet.  Since our 
payroll tax provider, ProBusiness, has partnered with Intuit to provide this 
service, you will be able to electronically download your individual W-2 data 
from ProBusiness directly into TurboTax through the Internet for free. Also, 
as part of this program, you can receive a  5% discount on all TurboTax and 
Quicken products including shipping and handling (go to 
www.probusinesstaxes.com for more information).

Q. So how does it work?
A. Embedded in each version of TurboTax 2000 (both the software and web 
application) is a series of screens that will ask whether your employer 
allows you to automatically download your data into TurboTax.  To use the 
free service, simply answer "yes" then select our payroll tax provider, 
ProBusiness, from a drop-down list of providers which includes ProBusiness, 
PeopleSoft, Ceridian, and seemyw2.com.  Validate your request by entering 
your social security number and W-2 box one data and your W-2 data will 
automatically transfer via the Internet into the appropriate locations in the 
TurboTax form.

Q. Is this a secure transaction?
A.  Intuit,s TurboTax ATR service combines Open Financial Exchange (OFX), the 
standard technology used in e-finance, with 128-bit military-grade encryption 
to create an advanced security protocol that ensures the highest level of 
security and confidentiality when obtaining financial data to populate your 
TurboTax form over the Internet.

Q. How do I participate in this program? 
A.  Only employees using Intuit,s TurboTax 2000 tax preparation and filing 
software can take advantage of this Web-based ATR service.  TurboTax software 
and the ATR Web-based filing service can be accessed at 
www.probusinesstaxes.com.
