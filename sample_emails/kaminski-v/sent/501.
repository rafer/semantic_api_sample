I shall be traveling for the rest of the week but my colleague 
Dr. Zimin Lu will call you to talk about different 
structures.

Vince,

Sorry that I missed your call yesterday.  I have a meeting from 2-3 today
(Tuesday), but otherwise any time in the afternoon works for me.  Let me
know what is convenient for you.  Thanks for your help.

Duane
