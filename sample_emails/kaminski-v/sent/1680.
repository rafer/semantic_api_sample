Subject: Get together for dinner


Hi everyone,

 before Grant leaves Houston, I wanted to have a small get-together at my 
house for dinner.  Since everybody is very busy, I want to schedule a date 
well in advance, so I am suggesting Saturday, Dec 2.  This will be dinner 
with family.  Please let me know if this works for you.

Thanks,
 Vasant
