Dear Professor Duffie,


I enclosed with this e-mail Enron Storage Analysis  Model (SAM) for your 
review.  The attached files include: 
 1) a brief documentation of the model (SAM.doc), 2) c-code of the main 
routines, 3) Excel spreadsheet interface, 
4) SAM_audit.dll .

Dr. Vince Kaminski, Dr. Stinson Gibner and myself have spent about one year 
in developing this model.  
With traders, feedback incorporated, the model results are close to reality.  
Although there are features to be included, 
we believe the model is ready for your review.  We look forward to your 
comments and suggestions. 


Please feel free to contact me should you need additional detail.  


Sincerely,



Zimin Lu
