Steve,

I have a book edited by Helyette regarding insurance derivatives.
I shall make a few copies of the most important articles
for you.

Vince, Vasant

I've just been speaking to Gillian Lockwood from our Tax group, who is 
interested in your work on ins. derivs.  Have you any general articles on the 
principles of pricing these instruments?

Many thanks,
Steve
