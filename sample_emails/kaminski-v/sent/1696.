Good morning Vince,

Christie has suggested that I be the liaison for John Martin and your 
research project 'Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself'.  

In John's lastest email, he suggested that the first week of December works 
with his schedule - up to December 6th - or the following couple of weeks 
after Dec. 8th.  Do these dates work for you as well?  If so, I will proceed 
in booking one hour sessions with the following Enron management:

Ken Lay
Jeff Skilling
Andy Fastow

If these dates do not work for you let me know when you are available and I 
will try to coordinate with John, Jeff, Ken and Andy.  Also, I will send an 
introductory email to John.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you,


Cindy Derecskey
