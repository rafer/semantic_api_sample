Paula,

Works for me. Maybe we should go out and explore some other options
in the Montrose/Heights area.

Subject: Round Table

We are lo-o-o-o-ng overdue for a meeting of the round table and it is time to 
work this into our schedules.

Please respond and let me know if Thursday, April 27th will work for 
everyone. I think LaGriglia would be a good place but am open to any and all 
suggestions. 

Thank you

Paula
