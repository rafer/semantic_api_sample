Vince,

If we face a delay with Maureen's article, I also have Giuseppe's solution to 
the probability problem that you asked him to write.  It is a page and a half 
and will do in a pinch.  See below.

Hi Will,

Vince asked me to write the solution to the little problem of two weeks ago.
Here it is, for the joy of the few aficionados of the newsletter.
Have a good weekend.


Giuseppe
