Subject: re:developing my electricity model at Enron



Dr. Kaminski:

I am the PhD student at the business school at Carnegie Mellon who is
interested in energy modeling. Thanks once again for taking the time
to talk with me about my model for electricity during your recent
visit to Carnegie Mellon. During our conversation, you had mentioned
the possibility of my coming out to Enron to work on developing my
model, possibly through an internship. Is this still an option? If so,
could you please advise me how to proceed.

Sincerely,

Aziz A. Lookman
