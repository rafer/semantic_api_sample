Steve,

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

Steven,
After further consultation with the Technical  Editor, we feel that your work 
would find a more suitable environment for  exposure in The Journal of Risk.
?
If you email a copy of your work (to the  Editor-in-Chief, Philippe Jorion) 
and outline what has happened to:
?
?pjorion@uci.edu
?
then I am sure that they will be keen to give due  consideration.
?
Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming  to this 
decision.
?
Best Wishes,
?
Navroz Patel,
Technical Assistant, Risk Magazine.
