Subject: Stinson Gibner & Hector Campos

Ken Lay gave a high profile presentation on the current natural gas supply 
and price situation at a recent conference held by the Interstate Oil and Gas 
Compact Commission, and some of the best graphs came from work that Stinson 
and Hector did (see the attached, slides #11, #12, #14, & #15).




I really appreciate their research and hope to be able to use their talents 
again for presentations for the Office of the Chairman..

- Rob
