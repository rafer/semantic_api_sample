Subject: Technical Corner for a week from Monday (10 Jul.)

Good Morning, Vince!

This is just a reminder that I will need some sort of technical article for 
the newsletter by the morning of 10 Jul. (since we won't have an issue this 
coming Monday).  I'd like to get a little earlier start and see if we can get 
one or two pieces by then.  What do you think?

By the way, I have Gwyn Koepke lined up as the "personality of the week" so 
we're okay there.

Best Regards,

Sam
