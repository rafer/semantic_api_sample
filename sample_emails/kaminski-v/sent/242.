	SPOT WEATHER ANOMOLIES QUICKLY
	
	Using Syncrasy's proprietary visualization tools, a user can quickly compare 
the output of up to 4 weather forecasting models for a specific time period. 
Syncrasy's visualization tool projects each model over an identical national 
grid, and a zoom feature allows synchronized zooming into any particular 
region of the continental US. For an example, view the Multi-Panel Graphicv 
on our website.

	QUANTIFY YOUR WEATHER RISK 
	
	
	
	[IMAGE]
	
	Syncrasy provides individual forecasts for over 1,600 weather stations in the 
continental US. For any one of these stations, you can compare all 14 weather 
forecasts side-by-side either to gain statistical confidence in a particular 
outcome or to quantify the weather risk of a specific forecast.  If you rely 
on weather forecasts, you should be aware of the extent to which all 14 
forecasts agree (or disagree) with each other. For an example, visit 
Syncrasy's  Forecast Analysis and Confidence Trading System (FACTS)v on our 
website. 
	
	WHICH WEATHER FORECAST IS MORE ACCURATE?
	
	Discover which weather forecast has been historically the most accurate for a 
particular city over any selected time period (such as last week, month, 
season, etc.). Refine your analysis with data filters.  For example, use a 
filter to determine which of the weather forecasting models is most accurate 
when actual temperatures are greater than 90 degrees, or when temperatures 
change more than 10 degrees within an hour.  For an example, see Syncrasy's  
Weather Accuracy & Vendor Evaluation System (WAVES)v on our website. 
	
	CONDUCT DETAILED, PRECISE ANALYSES USING "DIFFERENCE GRAPHICS"
	
	
	
	
	"Difference Graphics" refers to the spatially calculated difference for a 
single output. Difference Graphics allows a user to analyze discrepancies 
between any 2 weather forecasting models for any time period.  For example, 
using Difference Graphics, a user can view the difference in surface 
temperature between "Weather Vendor A" and "Weather Vendor B" across the US 
for tomorrow at 2pm.  A user could also view how "Weather Vendor A" has 
changed since the prior forecast. For an example visit Syncrasy's   
Difference Graphics.

	ENHANCE YOUR WEATHER COMPARISONS TO INCLUDE TRAILING AVERAGES
	
	The meteorological community frequently relies on one dataset for comparative 
purposes: the "30 year average." This "30 year average," however, may not be 
an ideal comparison as it is defined as the 30 year average over the period 
from 1961 to 1990. Syncrasy broadens the user's information by including 
options allowing users to compare any weather forecast to the trailing 30, 
15, 10, or 5 year averages.  
	
	A REAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION FIRST!

	Syncrasy's"Mach-5" technique expeditiously reports information to users in 
advance of typical weather data feeds which may experience bottlenecks during 
peak traffic (or rely on slower satellite communication). To prove Syncrasy's 
superior reporting speed, our system allows users to test our reporting speed 
for themselves by comparing our time stamps to that of their best alternative 
weather data source. Syncrasy records the time at which each weather forecast 
is available on Syncrasy's system (timestamp in dark green) as well as the 
anticipated time the weather forecast should update (timestamp in black). 
Users will find our data reports FIRST offering them a valuable competitive 
advantage! For an example, visit Syncrasy's  Model Status. 
	
	
	Syncrasy,s Weather Analysis Tool (SWATv
	
	SWATv collects timely and comprehensive  meteorologically diverse weather 
forecasts  from multiple forecasting groups, such as National Weather 
Service, universities, armed services, NASA and other research oriented 
institutions.  The data is integrated into a single analysis platform.  This 
platform includes a number of tools which may be useful to a trader and/or 
meteorologist.  For example, SWATv assists users in the following tasks:  
identifying and quantifying weather risk for some future time period; 
tracking the historical performance of different weather forecasting 
methodologies; and, creating a proprietary forecast. 
	
	SWATvcurrently collects  14 forecasts covering next hour through 16 days in 
the future.  This data (and risk analysis) is available on the SWATvbefore 
most companies (especially those companies that depend on traditional 
satellite links).  All these weather forecasts can be viewed graphically (as 
a national view or hemispheric view, were applicable) or viewed in a tabular 
format.
