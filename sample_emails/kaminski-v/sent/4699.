     THE DOCTOR,S OFFICE
  
The Doctor,s Office, located on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, offers 
convenient on-site medical care for all Active Enron employees who are 
enrolled in any of the Enron Corp. Medical Plan options (except the "No 
Coverage" option).  Dependents of employees, contractors and visitors are not 
eligible to receive these services, as well as employees not eligible for 
"Enron Corp." benefits.

Hours of Operation are:

Monday through Friday
7:30 am - 12:30 pm
1:30 pm -   2:30 pm (Closed for lunch from 12:30-1:30 pm)

Appointments are encouraged, but walk-ins are accepted.  To call for an 
appointment, call (713) 750-7074.

A $10 copayment is required for a visit at The Doctor's Office, regardless of 
the Medical Plan option you have elected.   You will be required to present 
your Medical Plan ID card on your first visit each year, so that your file 
may be updated.  Please bring cash or check covering your $10 copayment each 
time you visit The Doctor's Office.  (The Doctor's Office is not equipped to 
bill you for the copayment - please be prepared to make your copayment when 
you arrive for your appointment or you may have to return to your work 
location without receiving service.)  The Doctor's Office will also require 
you to update your patient information form each year so your file is 
complete.

If you are prescribed medications at The Doctor's Office, they can be ordered 
through Maxor Pharmacy (located at Christus/St. Joseph Hospital) and 
delivered to The Doctor's Office twice daily.  You will be contacted when 
your order has arrived and you may pick it up from The Doctor's Office during 
their normal business hours.  PLEASE BE PROMPT IN PICKING UP YOUR MEDICATION, 
AS ALL PRESCRIPTIONS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE PHARMACY IF NOT PICKED UP WITHIN 
24 HOURS.  You may pay for your order by cash, check or credit card.

Remember, prescription drug copayments are changing effective 1-1-2000:  
Generic medications are $8.00 and Name Brand medications are $16.00 for a 
30-day supply.  (If the medication prescribed has a generic equivalent but 
you receive the name brand medication, you must pay the difference in 
ingredient cost plus the generic copayment.)
