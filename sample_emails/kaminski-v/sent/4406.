David,

I sent a message with information to several different units but no 
response so far. I think people need a specific need to focus
and I shall keep the Chicago Partners in mind when a relevant
project arrives. I shall resend the message with attachments on
CP in a few weeks as a reminder.

Vince,

Hope this finds you well.  I am sure you are more than busy but I wanted to 
see
where we stand with feedback regarding me coordinating a potential 
presentation
by Chris Culp at CP Risk Management.

Regards,
David
