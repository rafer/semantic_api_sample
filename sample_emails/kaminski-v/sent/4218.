Jana,

Sounds perfect. Look forward to meeting
you on Saturday. Any suggestions regarding the movie?

You missed a really fun party last night.  The turnout was even better than
we had hoped--about 250 people.

How about Saturday, April 15 for a 5:00 pm (or so) movie and then dinner?

Have a good weekend,and I hope to see you Tuesday evening at the HEA/NYMEX
Crawfish Boil!

Jana
