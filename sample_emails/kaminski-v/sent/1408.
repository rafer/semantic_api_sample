Dear Vince,

I am sorry for the dely in answering. These are their phone numbers:

Ernesto Hernandez:  (713) 532-0573
Carlos Gorrichategui: (713) 668-0408.

The best way to get a hold of them at this point would be through
me. I would pass along the information and then they can contact you.

Cheers,

Carlos
