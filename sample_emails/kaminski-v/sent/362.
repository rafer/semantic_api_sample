Vince,

I have been meaning to invite you to my home for dinner for some time now, 
but you havew been so busy lately that I have not made a formal invite.

Please tell me what would be a convenient day, and we can plan for it.  I'd 
love for you to meet my wife, as well as see our daughter.

Regards,
Sandeep.
