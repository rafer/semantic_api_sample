Jana,

Saturday looks good. I shall be involved in job interviews at Enron
all Saturday and should be done by 5 p.m.

We can go the Angelica Movie Center. I shall check the program
tonight and call you tomorrow to review the options.

Vince

Vince,
How are you?  Are we still on for Saturday?

Let me know what movie looks good.  We saw "MI 2" and really liked it.  We
also saw "Small Time Crooks" and it was slow.

Jana
