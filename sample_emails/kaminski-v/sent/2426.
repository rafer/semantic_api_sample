Vince:  I very much enjoyed getting to know more about you yesterday
morning.  When do you return from Australia?  I would like to arrange
for you, I, and Tim Luehrman to meet so that you can learn more about he
and his vision and the possibilities laying ahead for PwC and its global
Financial Advisory Services practice.   I briefly talked with Tim and he
very much would enjoy receiving a copy of the publication in which you
referenced his tomato field model.  Can you send it to me by
"attachment" file?  Also, your resume and other info you might provide?
I hope to see you again soon or at least upon your return from
Australia.  Best regards, Al Arfsten
