This correspondence is sent to you in response to the below question 
pertaining to the type of research  that should be introduced to Enron .

On Tuesday , April 4th, 2000, a local newspaper in my area , "The Bakersfield 
California" ran an article pertaining to the 50 million dollars of funding 
from the U.S. congress  set aside to study deep sea floor extraction of 
methane hydrate. This study will focus on methane hydrates as an energy 
source and the technologies needed for safe, efficient development.  

According to this article, the ice-like deposits of frozen methane have an 
energy potential equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels 
combined.

I can fax you a copy of this newspaper article if you would like to read it . 
Send me you FAX number or call me at Enron Wind Corp. 661-823-6433. 

Also when I was in engineering  student back in 1985,  I did an independent 
senior level study on a proposed method which possibly could be used to 
extract hydrate from the sea floor. If you are interested, I could e-mail you 
a copy of my thesis explaining  this proposed method .

"Given appropriate latitude and funding, what is the one kind of research 
that you would like to introduce to Enron -- and what kind of talent would 
you need?"

Do you still believe that nothing can travel faster than light?  A recent 
experiment conducted in Princeton, NJ has proved this wrong.  

Reliant says it will file a plan with the Texas PUC to break into two 
publicly traded companies.
