Subject: The GARP Convention: Instructions to Chair




Dear Vince
?
The GARP 2001 Convention is nearly upon us! At this  time, I would like to 
send you some information concerning the Convention and  the stream that you 
will be Chairing on Tuesday 13th February.
?
When you arrive at the Convention, please make your  way to the Convention 
Registration desk, where I will greet you and register you  for the event. I 
will then show you to your conference room. As speakers arrive,  I will 
introduce them to you. 
?
As Chair, you will introduce and sum-up?the  stream.?You will also introduce 
individual speakers. Attached are the  biographies of the speakers that will 
be presenting during your stream. May I  recommend that you read these in the 
meantime and also bring them with you on  the day so as you can introduce the 
speakers prior to their presentations. Below  is an outline of the order of 
speakers in your stream.
?
I have allocated 40 minutes per session, with five  minutes between sessions 
for change around time between speakers. Most speakers  will speak for 30-35 
minutes and allow about 10 minutes for Q and A. Should a  speaker?seem like 
they are reaching the limits of their time, the Chair  will bring this 
to?their attention prior to the last?5 minutes  allocated to them.?It is also 
the role of the Chair to?ask the  delegates for questions, asking each 
questioner?for their name and the  organisation they represent. Should 
delegates be a little slow on?the Q and  A take-up, often the Chair will have 
some thought-provoking questions to put  forward. I shall ensure that there 
are GARP people in the room with microphones  to hand to delegates with a 
question.
?
There may be occasion for the Chair  to?announce some housekeeping on behalf 
of GARP.
?
If you have any questions?please do not  hesitate to contact me, otherwise I 
look forward to meeting you in a couple of  weeks.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas?
