The Associate and Analyst Department has finalized fall recruiting dates.  An 
important part of our recruiting effort is the final round of interviews 
which are conducted here in the Enron Building on selected weekends during 
October, November and December.   These are the famous &Super Saturdays8.   

We invite you to attend and participate in this process.  We will need 
approximately 50-75  volunteers for each Super Saturday to participate either
