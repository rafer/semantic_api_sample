Vince,
As we discussed, subject to minor changes the attached paper will appear in
the J of Applied Corporate Planning.  I'd be most interested in your
comments.
By the way, if you like the yield curve generation process described in the
paper, we'd be happy to perform a simulation, so that you can compare the
results based on the to the HJM procees.
I look forward to getting together with you when you come to NY to attend
the GARP conference, around February 13.  Just give me a brief warning.
Regards,
Andy
