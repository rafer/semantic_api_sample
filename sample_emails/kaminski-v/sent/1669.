NOTE FROM MARK FREVERT

With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created 
this e-mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various 
businesses.  I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you 
will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in your 
group.

To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our 
Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767.  Communication 
is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improve 
communication across our wholesale businesses.

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minutes 
to complete &The Pulse8 survey.  This annual survey regarding the work 
experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of the 
two-way communication process at Enron.  Please go to the Enron intranet and 
type survey.enron.com.  It only takes a few minutes, it,s confidential and 
your comments will help make Enron a better place to work.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Natural Gas
Middle Marketing,s biggest trade of the year so far occurred this month.  The 
significant transaction was a five year, multimillion dollar restructuring 
with a subsidiary of Formosa Plastics, one of the world,s largest producers 
of polyvinyl chloride.

Additionally, Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, has hedged 
a considerable amount (1.2 million barrels/month) of crude oil.   Winter 
Nymex hedges were put in place for the undisputed heavyweight chip champ of 
the world, Frito Lay.

Pulp & Paper
With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of Clickpaper.com, 
Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper 
commodities.  Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price 
transparency and reliability and access to Enron,s online financial markets.

Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives 
into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron,s trading 
business.  To date, Clickpaper.com has traded over 1 millions tons of pulp 
and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million.

Upstream Origination
Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natural 
gas products to optimize commercial value associated with the natural gas 
grid on the continent and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).  Through products such 
as storage, electric compression and producer services & outsourcing, ENA 
creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas 
infrastructure to be more efficient.  In addition, Upstream Origination 
transactions exploit the unique relationship between development of strategic 
assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of the 
market information created by those assets.
