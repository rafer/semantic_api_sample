Vince,

As you suggested, I splited the paper into two parts, the first one
devotes to the FX market and second one to gas market.  Attached
is the first part.

Let me know if there is any mistakes in there,  thanks.




Sam,

Vince wants to publish this article in the next Monday edition of the 
research intelligence.
Thanks.

Zimin
