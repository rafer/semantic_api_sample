I know that Chris is away and so siad to contact  you with any problems. Just 
want to know the status of the article for this  month? The last e-mail from 
Chris said it was getting a final look over from  Vince Kaminski and I should 
expect it a few days and that was last Thursday. Any  news, as we're due to 
go to press in a week and a day.
