Subject: Managing Energy Price Risk Articles

Hi Vince, I have a quick question for you.  The EOL folks want to put a 
couple of articles from the Risk book (Managing Energy Price Risk) on the 
internet.  I told them that  would be a copywrite violation.  Is there 
someone at Risk they could call to get permission for this, or is it even 
worth calling?  Thanks

Ross
