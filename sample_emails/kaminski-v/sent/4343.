Subject: New Information about our IT group

Hi, Vince and Zimin
 Our group has some major change.  Our director, Tom Moore, will move to 
London starting May 1. 
 In this changing  environment, it might be good for transferring  to happen.
 If I got your permission, I can talk to IT people directly.

Regards
