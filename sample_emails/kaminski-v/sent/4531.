Subject: Enron's Advertising Campaign

At Enron, we seek to achieve excellence in all that we do.  So, we made sure 
that our new advertising campaign came from the most talented people in the 
business.  

You.

We asked Enron employees, &How do you drive change, push the envelope, create 
new businesses?8  Unanimously, you told us that you constantly question the 
status quo and refuse to accept  &impossible8 as an option. You believe that 
there is always a better way to do things.  You ask, &Why?8

Asking why is the culture at Enron, a culture that is Enron,s foundation.  We 
celebrate this word each day at work, and we celebrate this word in our new 
advertising campaign. 

On Sunday, Feb. 6th we launch our new international advertising campaign 
entitled &Ask Why.8  The campaign begins with an &Ode to Why,& representing 
the culture at Enron. Another ad uses the imagery of a man locked in a metal 
suit, symbolizing the way other people do business ) constrained by 
conventional thinking.  In March, the campaign will continue with two 
additional commercials proving the success of Enron,s innovative thinking.

You can watch the national debut this Sunday on CBS,s &Face the Nation8 at 
9:30a.m. CST and &60 Minutes8 at 6p.m. CST.  Beginning next week, you will be 
able to view the entire campaign on-line at www.enron.com. For a schedule of 
future network and cable airings and an electronic wallpaper for your 
computer desktop, please visit our intranet site at home.enron.com.
