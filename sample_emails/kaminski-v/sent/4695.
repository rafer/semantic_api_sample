Subject: New ESAI "Flow of Funds" Report




Dear Clients:

Attached is a new ESAI report that takes the analysis of trends in financial
markets one step further: into equity market valuations of energy companies.
We intend to issue this report monthly.

There is an enormous amount of information about money flows behind this
report. For the sake of brevity, we have presented only a selection of what
we evaluate to derive these new forecasts of energy index prices. Please
direct feedback to Ed Krapels at ekrapels@esaibos.com. "
