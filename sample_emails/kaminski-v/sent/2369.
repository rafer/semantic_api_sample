Subject: Solar flare insurance derivatives

Vasant,

Anjam and I were just discussing that the telecommunications industry might 
be interested in some type of "solar flare" insurance derivatives.  Please 
let us know if you would be interested in meeting us next week sometime to 
discuss this further or if you have some ideas about it already.  Thank you.
