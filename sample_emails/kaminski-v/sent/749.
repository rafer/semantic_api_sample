Ian,

I shall ask our lawyer to prepare a standard
non-disclosure agreement. 

As soo as it is executed,
I shall send you a copy of the binder.

Please, don't distribute it: It's an internal document.

By the way, when is your trip?

Vince

Subject: Real Options


Hi!
When we last spoke you mentioned that you have workshops on real options at 
Enron.
Is there any chance that I could see the materials that you use?  I would 
like to prepare for a visit to your HQ, which would probably be more 
effective if I knew more about what approaches your people are using.
This material would be treated with strict confidentiality and I would be 
happy to sign any confidentiality agreements
