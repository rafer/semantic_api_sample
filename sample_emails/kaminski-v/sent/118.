Mike,

I am sending you a message regarding a potential candidate.


Please, take a look at him and see if he fits better our
group or Mark Tawney's group.

Vince

Subject: Recruiting for weather risk management group




Dear Vince and Christie,

?

I hope that you are both well, and are ready for the onset of summer in 
Houston!? I was disappointed that I was not able to see you at the final 
Tiger Team presentations last month due to a family emergency.? I hope that 
the teams, analyses will be helpful to your work, and echo their appreciation 
of your involvement and support.

?

I am writing with a question regarding recruiting for Enron,s weather risk 
management group. ?My boyfriend, Greg Hunt, is currently seeking 
opportunities to combine his background in meteorology (MS and 2 years of 
research at Lawrence Livermore Nat,l Lab) and an MBA in finance and 
information technology.? I began thinking about Enron,s work in weather 
derivatives, and realized that there could possibly be a great fit there.

?

I have copied Greg on this message, and would appreciate any suggestions you 
can offer regarding opportunities in this group. ?Thank you very much!

?

Best regards,

?

Heather
