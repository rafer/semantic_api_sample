Dear Professor Duffie,


I enclosed with this e-mail Enron Storage Valuation Model (ESVM) for your 
review.  The attached files include:  1) a brief documentation of the model 
(ESVM.doc), 2) c-code of the main routines, 3) Excel spreadsheet interface, 
4) ESVM.dll .

Dr. Vince Kaminski, Dr. Stinson Gibner and myself have spent about one year 
in developing this model.  With traders, feedback incorporated, the model 
results are close to reality.  Although there are features to be included, we 
believe the model is ready for your review.  We look forward to your comments 
and suggestions. 


Please feel free to contact me should you need additional detail.  


Sincerely,



Zimin Lu
