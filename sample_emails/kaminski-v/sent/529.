BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Midwest Origination
Beginning late 2000, East Power Marketing implemented a complete market 
coverage strategy.  Since then, EPMI has begun to develop relationships with 
hundreds of small &mom & pop8 municipalities.  Many of these munis had no 
prior contact with Enron.  As a result, East Power has executed a valuable 30 
MW energy call option term purchase from the Municipal Energy Agency of 
Nebraska (MEAN) at a congested location.

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has renamed Pulp, Paper & Lumber to Forest Products in order to fully 
encompass our multiple product offerings.

East Power Development
The Planning and Zoning Commission for Pompano Beach, FL approved ENA's 
rezoning request and site plan for the Pompano Beach Energy Center, a 510 
megawatt peaking power plant.  On the rezoning request, the vote was 6 to 1, 
and on the site plan, the vote was 7 to 0.  The rezoning request will be 
forwarded to the Pompano Beach City Commission for their review.  
Additionally, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has 
announced its intention to issue an air permit for the facility.

Next steps include a DEP public hearing on Monday, March 26, and the first of 
two votes on the rezoning request before the Pompano Beach City Commission, 
which is scheduled for Tuesday, March 27.

Open Forum Editorial in The San Francisco Chronicle  by Kenneth Lay    3/1/01
What has happened in California over the past four years is not 
deregulation.  It is misguided regulation. 

Deregulation does not mean eliminating customer choice and competition for 
most customers.
Deregulation does not mean limiting new market entrants.  Fewer than five 
percent of customers in California are served by competing suppliers.

Deregulation does not mean creating a single central power pool from which 
all participants must buy and sell their wholesale power; the state Power 
Exchange effectively replaced three monopoly buyers with one monopoly buyer.

Deregulation does not mean buying all of your commodity at the last minute, 
on the spot market, rather than planning ahead and purchasing most of the 
power under long-term contracts that lock in prices.

The situation in California is the result of continued regulation, 
complicated by a series of natural and man-made factors.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Wind
Enron Wind has purchased the factory facilities of the Dutch company, Aerpac, 
Europe's second largest producer of wind turbine rotor blades.  This move 
represents a significant step towards fulfilling Enron Wind's strategic 
objective of manufacturing high-quality and technically sophisticated rotor 
blades in-house.  Enron Wind will be using its own moulds to produce the 
rotor blades.  The acquisition of the Almelo-based factory facilities, which 
are only 60 kilometres from Enron Wind's facilities in Salzbergen, Germany, 
gives the company a convenient base for European wide distribution.

Enron applies for Greek electricity trading license
Enron, through its subsidiary Enron Power MEPE, has applied for an 
electricity supply license for Greece, for the 34% market opening on Feb 19th 
2001.  If the license application is successful, Enron will be allowed to 
approach customers consuming more than 100GWh up to a combined total peak 
capacity of 350MW.  In total, 4 companies have applied for power trading 
licenses (Enel, ATEL and Cinergy also applied).
