Hi, Christe

Thanks. The objective of the meeting with Jeff Shankman is to use his powers 
of persuasion
to make sure that John Arnold and Louise Kitchen can make   presentations to 
the Tiger
Team. We can also talk to them  about getting some other people from their 
units to make presentations 
to the team.
