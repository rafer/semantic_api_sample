Julie Gomez asked if we could talk with Rayfael.   He is an engineer at NASA 
who is interested in learning about fianancial risk management.   He will be 
coming to Enron the morning of April 19th (Thursday) for some informal 
discussions starting at 8:00.   Paulo and I are planning to talk with him.

Vasant:  Are you available that morning?

Vince:  Anyone else you would like to include?

Thanks,

Stinson
