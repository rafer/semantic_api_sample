Subject: Mission Impossible - HR Associate Groups Recommendation and next 
steps

Rhonna,

Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this 
message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will 
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).

The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps 
required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the 
development of an HR "value index" at Enron.

I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.

David
