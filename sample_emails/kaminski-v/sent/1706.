Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.

Vince
