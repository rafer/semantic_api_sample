Very well!  Here is the text of Brad's bio piece.

-----------------

I began working for the Research Group here at Enron in mid-May as a summer 
intern.  I started work back-testing storage models immediately after the 
Spring semester, and I have enjoyed every minute since then.  

I am pursuing a B.S. and a professional Masters degree in Chemical 
Engineering at Rice University, and plan to graduate with both degrees next 
May.  I went to a small high school in Fort Worth, and Rice was the perfect 
place to go from there because of its size and location.  I have taken 
primarily chemistry, biochemistry, and engineering courses while at Rice, and 
during the past summers I have worked in chemistry research labs in Fort 
Worth.  

Outside of work and school, I am an avid baseball fan and appreciate good 
music and cooking (though my cooking can at times be unpredictable.)  I have 
grown to love Houston as a city, and though I,ll never concede that it is 
better than my hometown of Fort Worth, it has been a great place in which to 
go to school and work.

Since my education thus far has been somewhat limited to Chemical 
Engineering, I have valued this opportunity to work in the Research Group, 
both as a chance to use engineering techniques that I have learned, and to 
learn more about the business world than I would have by simply taking 
economics classes.  I am not certain what I will do upon graduating from 
Rice, but my experience here has taught me that my opportunities are much 
greater and better than I had previously thought.

Good Morning, Vince!

Please pardon the brief interruption, but how is the article coming?
