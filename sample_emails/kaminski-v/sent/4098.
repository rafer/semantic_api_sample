Lenos

I'd like to give a talk entitled "Diagrammatic Representation of Real Options 
in Enron", in which I will give a brief run-down of a diagrammatic technique 
I have developed for representing real option deals.  My notation allows 
originators, managers and quants to communicate unambiguously, while still 
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality.  I have defined 
a "diagrammatic grammar" which guarantees that the pricing of the deal 
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram.

I propose to introduce the symbols and grammar, then go on to present some 
suitable examples of diagrams.  If appropriate I'll talk about the links with 
dynamic programming.  (I will need some guidance as to how much technical 
detail I can go into based on the audience.)

All the best,
Steve
