BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Risk Management
Next week, Jeff Shankman and Mark Tawney will be attending the Weather Risk 
Management Association (WRMA) conference in Tokyo. There has been 
a lot of interest in Japanese weather derivatives to-date.  Even though Japan 
is geographically a relatively small country, due to elevation differences, 
there are several different climates and within each of those areas, there,s 
a significant amount of volatility in day-to-day and season-to-season 
weather. By leveraging EnronOnline and our global portfolio approach, Enron 
Global Markets will be the dominant weather market player in Japan, as we are 
in
the US, Australia and Europe.

IN THE NEWS

Analyst Robert C. Ollech, vice president and portfolio manager at Ziegler 
Investment Services Group, says Wall Street will like Enron even more as 
demand for natural gas increases, volume continues to grow on its online 
marketplace and as the company's broadband business starts making money.  
Enron, which has beat analysts' estimates in five of the past seven quarters, 
is not a cheap stock. But Ollech says its relatively young management team is 
focused on maximizing systems and business lines it has spent five years 
developing. Plus, the company is selling such assets as a power plant in 
Oregon, moves Ollech says could boost its return on equity to 18% or higher 
from the present 12%. "This is an innovative story that's finally getting 
out," Ollech says. 02/25/2001  The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Enron Seeks Deals for Japanese Assets 
The Japanese unit of U.S. power producer and trader Enron is considering 
asset swaps with Japanese power companies, in a deal that would make Enron 
the first
foreign company to buy a Japanese power plant. An Enron Japan official said 
it is talking to power companies and "owners of power generators in Japan 
about 
the possibility of asset exchanges," confirming a report in the Japanese 
business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The report also said Enron Japan may 
enter deals
with Japanese companies for joint power-generation acquisitions abroad. 
Japanese deregulation measures have opened the door to new foreign and 
domestic 
competitors in an industry dominated for years by 10 regional Japanese firms. 
Enron Japan was established last May, two months after deregulation measures
were passed allowing nonutility companies to begin supplying power to large 
commercial users such as shopping centers and office towers.
