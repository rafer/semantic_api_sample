Vince,

Here's Bob's bio.  It's pretty short, but I expanded his picture a bit to 
compensate.  I also had to convert it from third person to first, so it's a 
little "I" heavy.

I joined the Pricing and Evaluation Technology Group in June, 2000.  I,m 
currently working on pricing models for commodity options and time series 
analysis to relate commodity and equity prices.

I have completed an M.S. in Financial Engineering at the University of 
Michigan in April, 2000 and have also been an independent organization 
development consultant for 15 years with extensive work in electric and gas 
utilities.  Prior to that, I managed a methods development group for a 
nuclear reactor manufacturer for 16 years.

From a few years back,  I,ve earned  a BS (Aero. Eng.) from Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute, an MS (Nuclear Science) from Vanderbilt University and 
a Ph.D. (Nuclear Engineering) from Rensselaer.

When away from Enron, my outside interests include yoga and grandchildren.
