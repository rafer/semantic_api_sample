Subject: Real Options Presentation



Dear Vince,

Thank you for a stimulating presentation about real options at the IIR
conference in New York on Monday the 13th of December. Your explanation of 
real
options and it's applications for a number of valuation problems interested me
very much. With reference to our previous conversation I wonder if it is
possible  for you to forward the slides from the presentation.

Thank you very much for your help

Regards

Erik
