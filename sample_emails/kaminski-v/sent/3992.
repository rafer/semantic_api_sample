Michael,

The science of measuring operational risk is in its early stages of 
development.
There are really no cook-book  solutions. One has to use creativity and a lot
of common sense.

Mr. Kaminsky,

Recently, I read articles published by GARP and monographs in a book 
published by GARP.  Although they are excellent sources of introduction to 
operational risk, none of them have any details on the "how to."

If you know of a good book or book(s) could you recommend one?  

Thank you.

Michael Kim
