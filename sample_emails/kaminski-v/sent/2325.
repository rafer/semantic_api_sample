Subject: PoolMod Memo

Vince, as I mentioned, attached  please find an overview memo on the PoolMod 
model. We would like to invite your group to attend a meeting with the people 
from London Economics (tentatively Thursday noon) to discuss the benefits of 
using this model to predict pool prices in Colombia


Thanks, Maria Elena
