FYI--
I don't know if any of you like to play poker, but if you do, take a look at 
the invitation below.  This is a fun party my hubby does every year and we 
usually have a handful of Enron people , along with alot of our friends, and 
friends of friends.  If you want to come or want more info, just let me know 
(or better yet just send an e-mail to Paul at shak@ev1.net).  You are welcome 
to invite anyone--just let Paul know so he has an idea of the number of 
players.  

Just for your info, it's a real simple tournament where only two games are 
played, and the most money you can lose is $100.  The amount you can win 
depends on the number of players, but last year's winner won $1471 (with 29 
players).  The tournament starts at 2:00 and lasts well into the evening.  We 
have people from all walks of life, including a couple of police officers who 
usually play, and everyone has a good time.

You are welcome to tell other people in your groups about this if you think 
they'd be interested--I just sent it to a few people.....

POKER TOURNAMENT AT SHAK'S HOUSE 
SATURDAY, 9 September 2000, 2 PM SHARP! 

It's poker tournament time again!? Only e-mail invitations are being sent 
this year, so if you 
know any one who was not there last year or anyone who does not have an 
e-mail account, 
please let them know about it. 

We have room for 42 players and we hope to fill every seat.? The bigger the 
pot, the better!! 
Please RSVP by e-mail to shak@ev1.net or by phone at 281-482-3920.? An 
accurate count 
sure helps with the food and beer planning since, as usual, we will feed you 
all well as you play. 
Last year we had 29 players--at the end of this e-mail there is a recap of 
last year's results-- 
who won how much in the tournament as well as the Calcutta pool.? Below you 
will also find the 
rules for this year's tournament. 

Please call or e-mail if you need directions.? I will send an e-mail reminder 
about one week before the 
tournament.? Although the rules are set for this year's tournament, before we 
start play there will be a 
vote on whether or not to add a third game (Omaha), and a few other possible 
rule changes for the 2001 
tournament.

SHAK'S 5th ANNUAL (1999) POST LABOR DAY POKER TOURNAMENT RESULTS 
Twenty-nine people played in 1999.? Mike Straka, returning 1998 poker 
tournament champion, came to defend his title, but fell short at 11th place.? 
Brian Stehling won the tournament and more importantly, the coveted first 
place trophy.? Oh yeah, by the way, Brian,s winning share of the poker pool 
was $1471.? One of the rookies, (well, actually a ringer brought in by Cass 
Landry) won second place--Steve Poore took home $535.? Third place was won by 
another rookie, Robert Sanchez, making him $401 richer.? And I, the 
tournament sponsor (Shak), won fourth place and $268*yes, I actually won a 
game this year! 

1999 CALCUTTA RESULTS 
The Calcutta pool was worth a stunning $886 in 1999.? First place player 
Brian Stehling, who sold for $35 to Bob Donalson, was worth $487.? Steve 
Poore came in second and was owned by his wife, Laura Poore, who paid $27 and 
collected $266*I guess they,re not so &Poore8 any more!? Miguel Prado owned 
third place winner Robert Sanchez and paid $23.? At least he took home $89 in 
the Calcutta pool, since he didn,t fare quite so well playing poker.? John 
Maler gave up the position? of LAST PLACE and improved this year to 15th.? 
Miguel Prado stole the &first-out8 honors and was owned by Brian Stehling & 
Parker Garcia.? For the honor of owning LAST PLACE Miguel Prado and paying 
$25, Brian & Parker got to split $44. 

1999 DOOR PRIZE RESULTS 
This year we had two door prizes, but we were only able to give one away*
well, we kinda, gave it away.? I (Shak) won the first Four-of-a-Kind prize of 
$25 cash.? No one was lucky enough to get a Royal Straight Flush, so the free 
round trip ticket to Las Vegas will be available in the year 2000 tournament.
