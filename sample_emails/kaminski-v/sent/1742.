Vince,

Please check the University of California Energy Institute web site (
http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/). You may already be aware of it but if 
you are not, there are lots of paper that I am using as a reference and that 
you might be interested in reading them. Also, every year they are holding a 
one day power conference in UC Berkeley. I'd like to attend the one in March 
of 2001. Is that fine?

Sevil,
