Subject: Real Options

Vince,

The Sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option 
to participate in building a wind farm. Should this proceed, we would like to 
mark this option "to market".

Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and 
remarking real options? Alternatively, do you have any suggestions as to the 
best way to value, and book, real options fairly?

Regards
Paul Smith
