Subject: Meeting Monday morning

Confirming a meeting to discuss the appropriate valuation assumptions for 
Clean Fuels.  Let's meet in Dwight Larson's office (EB 4912) at 9:30 AM..

Kerry, I suspect this is the first time that you have heard about this 
meeting, but I think you could add value to the discussion.  Hope you can 
make it.  Feel free to call either Dwight or me for any further clarification 
you might need.

Thanks, JNG
