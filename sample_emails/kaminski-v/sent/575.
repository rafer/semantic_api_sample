Iris,

I think that your badge has  not been activated 
for the access to the floor after 7 p.m. or the weekends.

We shall take care of it.

Vince

Hi,

     Last nite after using the gym I tried to return to my cubicle to pick up 
my coat, brief case, etc.

     I was unable to get onto our floor.


     Is there a time-sensitive access for my badge?

     If so, can this be remedied.  I will be using the gym most nites and 
don't want to have to bring my gym bag home each nite.


Thanks,
Iris
