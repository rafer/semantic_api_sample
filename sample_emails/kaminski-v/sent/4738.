Ben,

Let me review it one more time from this angle. If you don't hear from me by 
Wednesday,
it's OK to post it.

Subject: Credit Risk technical article

Vince,

Bijoya is currently working on the development of the website for the new 
credit trading initiative, and we thought it would be a good idea to put my 
recent technical article "Measuring Credit Risk" on it. Are you okay with 
this release, or does it contain any proprietary information we should edit 
out?

Ben
