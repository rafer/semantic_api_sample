Mark,

I have an inquiry from a publishing house who are preparing a book on the 
world power markets.
They wanted us to sponsor it (at the cost of 19,000 pounds) but the reaction 
from our power desks
was  lukewarm.

They are offering us an opportunity to advertise in this publocatio.
 I am attaching the message with the terms.

Vince
