Management.  In his new role, Kevin will devote the vast majority of his time 
and efforts to building a successful bandwidth intermediation business for 
Enron, in addition to providing global risk management oversight.  Kevin will 
report to Enron,s Office of the Chairman and will serve on the Executive 
Committee. Because of his efforts to build bandwidth intermediation 
capabilities, he also will report to the Office of the Chairman of Enron 
Broadband Services.

he will fully dedicate his efforts to ENA,s continued growth and success.
