Subject: Real Options 2001 Conference



Vince, 

I was invited to speak in the International Quality and Productivity Center 
Real Options 2001 
conference,  in place of you.   The time is March 27-28.  The only benefit 
for the speaker is
that he can take another person for half price.   The two day conference 
costs $1699.
I have put the conference program on your desk. The main focus is on energy, 
high tech
and drug companies.

I am wondering if anybody in the group should go.  Any suggestions ? 

Zimin
