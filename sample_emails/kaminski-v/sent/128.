Steve, 
Not a bad move for NEM.

I got it at 17.5 when the option was exercised against me.

good morning,  strong open today. You can buy your NEM and  AU. However, I 
will be glad to debate the point of whether inflation will be a problem for 
the foreseeable future.

Buy ATSN and ACTU on open 

Steve
