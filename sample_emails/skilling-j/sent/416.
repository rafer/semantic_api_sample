Judy, my apologies for the delay in responding to your request.  The meeting 
is scheduled to take place at Enron Broadband Services facility located at 
727 N. Shepherd Drive.  I have attached a map for your file.  There are no 
hotels in that area, but hotels located downtown are approximately 15 minutes 
away by taxi or car.  I would suggest the DoubleTree Allen Center 
(713.759.0202), the Downtown Hyatt Regency (713.654.1234), or the Four 
Seasons Hotel (713.650.1300).  Should you have any problems securing a room, 
please let me know.  I'll be contacting you and the other speakers within the 
next week to arrange a conference call.  In the meantime, please let me know 
if you have any other questions.  Regards, Sherri

Jeff,

I am planning Kevin Compton,s travel to Houston for the YPO panel.
Please send me the name and address of the building where this will take
place.  Also, since he will be coming in the night before, which hotels
would you recommend?

Thank you.
