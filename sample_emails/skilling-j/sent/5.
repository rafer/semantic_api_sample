Awais,

Mr. Skilling receives this report every day, which he is very interested in 
seeing; however, especially when traveling, he is most interested in the 
summary e-mail, not the lengthy attached document.

I print this page for him everyday and fax it to him if traveling.  
Unfortunately, there appears to be something in the margins that prevents the 
"To Date" column from printing.  Could you check into this and let me know if 
there is something we can do to make certain that the entire e-mail page 
prints?  Thanks for your assistance.  SRS
