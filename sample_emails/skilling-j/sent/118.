John,

Many thanks for agreeing to speak at our YPO session on April 24, 2001, in 
Houston.  The meeting will be held at Enron Broadband Services, network 
equipment staging building, which is close to downtown.  We anticipate 
attendance of about 100 people.

Breakfast will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the program will run from 8:15 a.m. to 
10:15 a.m.  The subject is "New Trends in Technology and Venture Capital."  
You will be on a panel discussion with two other venture capitalists.  I 
expect the tone will be highly informal, but I will schedule a conference 
call (probably in early March) to provide more details and specific topics of 
interest.

Again, John, thank you.  I look forward to seeing you in April.

Jeff
