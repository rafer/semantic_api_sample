  Hi, Kristin,

  Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.
He would like
  to meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch
the first time).
  I'm making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00
p.m.

  Would you please reply to this e-mail so I know you got it?
Thanks,
  Kristin, and have a nice lunch.

  Sherri
