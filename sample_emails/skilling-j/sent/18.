Subject: A few minutes of your time



Mr Skilling,

I would like to have the opportunity of talking with you  in person for 15 
min.-or-so sometime 
in the next couple of weeks (any time after Tuesday(I,m currently in 
California helping to kick-off the
Sun/BOS development team). I would like to talk to you about a couple of 
specific concerns I have
about the overall EBS organization. 

I have now been involved in ECI/EBS since our acquisition a year ago (I was 
in the Modulus group).  So 
I have first-hand knowledge of the development cycles of all of the current 
EBS products.

I also believe that I am in a fairly unique position in that I am not in any 
particular &political8 faction 
(I really don,t play the political game(I have enough Enron options that I 
don,t need to ).   And
I believe that I am fairly well respected by everyone (i.e. I don,t have any 
enemies!).

That, combined with my broad software and hardware technical background 
(including developing 
and supporting the InterAgent product for several years), gives me some 
useful insights into some of 
the technical  and structural issues of EBS.

If you cannot meet, then I can describe my concerns in an e-mail, if you 
prefer.

Please let me know if you are available.  I will also try to call your office 
to arrange a meeting.
I can be reached on my cell phone: 713-503-2605.  

Thank you for your time.

  -larry
