Hi Deborah -

Ken Lay does want to meet with you re:  your earlier e-mail.  I know this 
sounds incredible, but the really best date is not until September 26!!!  His 
schedule is just not to be believed!!!  He is pretty free that day, so he 
could do an early afternoon.  Would 2:00 p.m. work for you?

Thanks.

Rosalee
