Dear Steve:

 The Galleo mobile multimedia communicator looks very interesting.  As you 
may know, I am on the Compaq Computer board.  They have a very successful 
product that is somewhat similar referred to as the iPAQ.  They also have 
other wireless machines which I use.  I think for the time being I do not 
necessarily need to add one more.  But I do appreciate you thinking of me.

Ken
