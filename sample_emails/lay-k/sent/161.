Russell, I think it will be Kenneth.Lay@Enron.com.  Do we capitalize all the 
words, but com?  I noticed that mine is Rosalee.Fleming@Enron.com.  I had 
sent something to my home e-mail address.  This may not be a good test as I 
am sending it from my home computer, from his mail-box, but not from his 
computer.  Oh, well, we'll see!!
