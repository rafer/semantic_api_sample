Dear Mr. Lay,

As you are no doubt aware your colleague Jeffrey Skilling  recently made a 
keynote address at our flagship event RISK 2000 in Boston.  Building on the 
success of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote 
address at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences, third annual 
information technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote session 
is entitled "The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the 
electronic energy marketplace". This session has no  bullet points as I would 
like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My 
research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions on 
this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy 
schedule.

+Information Technology, will take a focused look  at the latest advances 
being made in the energy market,s systems and  technologies. The conference 
will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the 
chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams will 
be partitioned into five areas: 

1) Information technology for risk management

2) Information technology for pricing and trading

3) Data techniques and strategies

4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced 
by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached a 
copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software 
exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their 
products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have come 
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation 
from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at 
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let 
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk 
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract the 
leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated 
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly 
appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in 
this event. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to  get 
in touch.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Joel Hanley
