Hi Mr. Stelzer l-

I don't believe Ken has had an opportunity to review the suggestions in your 
outline.  He has a huge stack of mail he hasn't gotten to yet.  Hopefully, by 
tomorrow, he will have seen it.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Will do -- and I assume I can go ahead with all of the suggestions in my
outline. Right? Also, now that you are free of Blockbuster, should you and
Rupert get together again?
