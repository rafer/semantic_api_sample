I seem to have three appointments next week:

Tuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)

Wednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)

Thursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)


I plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take 
awhile.
