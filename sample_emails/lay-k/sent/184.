The purpose of this memo is to invite you to participate in the Partnership,s 
annual Board lobby trip to Washington, D.C.? This year,s trip, to be led by 
the Partnership Chairman Bruce LaBoon and Government Relations Advisory 
Committee Bill Wise, will occur Wednesday, June 6 and Thursday, June 7.? The 
delegation will leave Houston at approximately 3 p.m. on the 6th and return 
to Houston around 9 p.m. on the 7th.

?

You are likely familiar with the format for these trips.? We expect to secure 
use of Partnership-member corporate planes for air transport.? The 
Partnership will book hotel rooms for June 6, with participants responsible 
for hotel charges (approximately $300-$350); ground transport and meals will 
be arranged by the Partnership.

?

We,ll spend the full day the 7th in meetings.? The itinerary is in 
development.? We are planning a breakfast meeting with the full Houston area 
delegation and meetings with our two Senators, EPA, DOT, DOE, House 
Transportation Appropriations Chairman Rogers of Kentucky, and with the 
President,s staff at the White House.? We,ll end the day with a reception at 
the Capitol to which we will invite the entire Texas delegation, Houstonians 
in the Administration, the Texas Office of State-Federal Relations, 
Washington-based staff of Partnership-member companies, and so forth.

?

As you can imagine, it is easier for us to secure meetings when we can 
confirm the names of those who will be in our group.? Please indicate your 
ability to join the trip by checking the form below and returning it as soon 
as possible either by return email or fax to 713-844-0257.? Detailed briefing 
books and a final itinerary will be provided to you before your departure.

?

Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions you may have, at 
713-844-3624.? These trips have always proven to be substantive, informative, 
educational . . . and sort of fun, too!? I do hope you can join the Board 
delegation and will return the RSVP right away.? Thanks.
